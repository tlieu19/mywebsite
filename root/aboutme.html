        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>My name is Timothy. I'm a third-year senior at San Diego State
            University graduating in May 2022 with a major in Computer Science
            and a double minor in Management and Information Systems and
            Psychology. All of that at the peppy age of 20, before I can even
            legally drink.
        </p>

        <p>This pacing is in part due to the eleven AP classes and couple college
            courses I took in high school but mainly because when I enrolled I
            already knew I really wanted to learn about Computer Science.
        </p>

        <p>During my very first upper division Computer Science class I found myself
            spending hours writing code, procrastinating work in my other classes, 
            essentially living in the TA's office to talk about a myriad of different
            test cases or solutions. I was hooked.
        </p>

        <p>Now I'm looking for any practical experience in the Computer Science
            field to expand my knowledge and figure out what kind of career I 
            can become more passionate about.
        </p>
